site.description = Artificial additives in food have become a huge problem. Manufacturers are convincing us that all food additives used in the EU are safe, although scientific facts tell an altogether different story.\n\nOur idea is to gather all the info about food additive (colors, preservatives, flavor enhancers and other E numbers) as well as possible consequences of their consumption and show the products containing them.
